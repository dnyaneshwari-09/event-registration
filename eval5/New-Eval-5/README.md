# event registration

 
Created a streamlined event registration portal that facilitates event management for admins and registration for users.

This platform provides an intuitive interface for users to browse events and register for their chosen events.

* Developed an admin dashboard with tools to add, edit, and manage events, integrated user registration, scheduling, and

booking forms for a seamless experience, and designed interactive dashboards displaying upcoming events, allowing

users to register easily.

* Technical Implementation: ASP.NET Web API facilitated backend services for data handling and user interactions, while

Angular offered a modular and responsive front-end solution.
